# Load Project Context Protocol

Load project-specific context files from **both** the per-agent layer (`agent-[domain]/knowledge-base/[project]/`) and the shared layer (`shared-memory/[project]/context/`) into working memory. Supports listing all available context or loading specific files by keyword. Entries are presented with `[shared]` / `[private]` markers so the source layer is always visible.

*How* the entries are physically read is delegated to the active **storage backend** (see [Storage Mechanics](#storage-mechanics)).

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

- `/load-project-context` → List all project context files (both layers) with numbers, user selects which to load
- `/load-project-context [keyword]` → Auto-match files by keyword against tags and file names across both layers, load matches directly. Falls back to list mode if no match found

## Procedure

*IMPORTANT: Use TodoWrite tool with FULL VERBATIM copy of each step below (including all commands, examples, and sub-points) to prevent context loss and ensure complete execution*

### Step 1: Scan Available Project Context

List the project context entries across **both** layers (**§ list-context-entries**). Paths resolve through the [HOME contract component]([path-to-agent-memory-project]/components/home-contract.md): the shared layer is `CONTEXT_DIR`, the private layer is `KNOWLEDGE_DIR`.

**Silent skip**: If either layer is missing or empty for a given project, skip it without error. Only present what exists.

For each entry found, retain its **scope marker**:
- Private-layer entry → marker `[private]`
- Shared-layer entry → marker `[shared]`

If no context files are found in either layer, inform the user: "No project context files found. Use `/update-project-context` to create your first one."

### Step 2: Parse Arguments

Check if arguments were provided:
- **No arguments**: Go to Step 3 (List Mode)
- **Arguments provided**: Go to Step 4 (Match Mode)

### Step 3: List Mode

Present all project context files as a numbered list grouped by project, with the scope marker prefixed on each entry:

**Format:**
```
Project context files available:

[project-name-1]
  1. [shared] [theme].md — [description] (tags: tag1, tag2)
  2. [private] [theme].md — [description] (tags: tag1, tag2)

[project-name-2]
  3. [shared] [theme].md — [description] (tags: tag1, tag2)
  4. [private] [theme].md — [description] (tags: tag1, tag2)

Enter number(s) to load (e.g., "1", "1,3", "all"), or "cancel":
```

If a project has entries in only one layer, only that layer's entries are listed (no empty "shared" or "private" sub-list).

Wait for user selection, then go to Step 5.

### Step 4: Match Mode

Search for the keyword(s) from arguments across **both layers** against:
1. **Tags**: Match against `tags: [...]` in YAML frontmatter
2. **File names**: Match against the file name (e.g., keyword "deploy" matches `deployment.md`)
3. **Project names**: Match against project folder names

**If matches found**: Show what will be loaded and proceed to Step 5:
```
Found [N] matching context file(s) for "[keyword]":
  1. [shared] [project]/[theme].md — [description]
  2. [private] [project]/[theme].md — [description]

Loading...
```

**If no matches found**: Inform the user and fall back to Step 3 (List Mode):
```
No context files matching "[keyword]" found. Showing all available:
```

### Step 5: Load Selected Files

Read the selected entry or entries into agent context (**§ read-context-entry**).

After loading, confirm to the user with the scope marker for each file:
```
Loaded [N] project context file(s):
  - [shared] [project]/[theme].md (tags: tag1, tag2)
  - [private] [project]/[theme].md (tags: tag1, tag2)
```

## Storage Mechanics

The operations referenced above — **§ list-context-entries**, **§ read-context-entry** — are defined by the **active storage backend**:

- **Markdown (native)** — follow `storage-backends/markdown.md` → its `load-project-context` section.
- **DB (Hermod)** — the equivalents live in `storage-backends/db.md` → its `load-project-context` section (not yet implemented).

See the seam contract at `storage-backends/README.md` for how this swap works.
